# Plugin GODOT - External Web Audio
Version Godot 3.2.x

[![ProBrain](./poweredby-probrain.jpg)](https://probrain.com.br)

Plugin to use external web audio libraries within Godot, for this example we used : [![Howler](./howler.png)](https://howler.js)

# Features
 - You can implement any JS audio plugin in your Godot project
 - Work with hook methods, so you can manage methods with any external JS audio plugin
 - Standard Web Audio Manager
 - 2D Spatial Web Audio Manager
 - Group Audio Config Manager

# Upcoming Features
 - 3D Spatial Web Audio Manager

# Installation
- Paste the addons folder into your game project folder.
- Enable the Plugin "WebAudioExternal" in the Project Settings.

After that, two singletons will be add into your project, "JavascriptManager" and "AudioManager".
- JavascriptManager: Hook methods and properties from GoDot to JS.
- AudioManager: Have all generic methods and properties you can use in your Godot Project.

# Configuration
To config, you need to insert a res:// path to the audio library.
```sh
//Example of a relative path
AudioManager._audioMotorPath = ["res://howler.min.js"]
```
This plugin needs an AudioEngine class to work, it can be inserted at the end of AudioManager._audioMotorPath, the plugin will be instanciated at the end of the array. This plugin already has this class setted for you ;) it uses the Howler Library.
```sh
//Example of a relative path
AudioManager._audioMotorPath = ["res://howler.min.js","res://audioEngine.js"]
```
# Implementation with Howler
## Load Audios / Group Audios
```sh
AudioManager.loadAudios(_audio_names, _path, _config)
```
- _audio_names : list of audios to load, it's going to be related to the group.
- _path : is the path folder with your audios files, this _path will also be the audio_list groups name.

- _config : It's an object, where you can have any kind of properties that are related to the group. The config object will be passed to the audio object. Check some examples below.
```sh
#Example
AudioManager.loadAudios(["bean","correct"], "Sound/FX", {"loop":false, "pan":-1})
# Sound/FX - is the path to the audios, and is also the group's name. Remember, the path it's reffer to exported project folder, so the audios need to be inside manualy on exported folder.
# {"loop":false, "pan":-1} - passes the parameters to the Howler object, and loads the audio within that configuration.
```
## Fallbacks - Godot Signal
Any fallbacks in this plugin makes a request to the AudioEngine file, in order to validate the status of the fallback call.
- **updateProgressLoad** : returns a float that represents the loaded progress (From 0 to 1), to be used in any kinda of progressbar or loading screen.
- **loadedAllAudios** : fallback to sign all loaded audios.
- **audioEnd** : fallback for when the playing audio reaches its end, it returns the _audio_name when the audio finishes playing.

## Audio Control
- **play(audio_name, _config={})**: Begins to play the audio.
        - **audio_name**: Name of the audio you want to play.
        - **_config**: you can pass a config object with any property you may need to change. If nothing is passed, it will load the standard config settings for the group. You can check at [Howler Documentation](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js#plugin-spatial) all avaiable atributes.
```sh
#Example
AudioManager.play("bean",{"loop":true})
# {"loop":false, "pan":-1} - pass the parameters to the Howler object, and loads the audio with that configuration.
```

- **stop(_name)** : Stops the current playing audio, or a whole Group of Audios.
        - **_name** : Name of the audio you want to stop, or the name of the group of audios you want to stop.
```sh
#Example
AudioManager.stop("bean") // audio
or
AudioManager.stop("Sound/FX") // group
```

- **pause(_name)** : Pauses the current playing audio or a Group of Audios.
        - **_name** : Name of the audio you want to pause, or the name of the group of audios you want to pause.
```sh
#Example
AudioManager.pause("bean") // audio
or
AudioManager.pause("Sound/FX") // group
```

- **mute(_name)** : Mute the current playing audio, or a whole Group of audios.
        - **_name** : Name of the audio you want to mute, or the name of the group of audios you want to mute.
```sh
#Example
AudioManager.mute("bean") // audio
or
AudioManager.mute("Sound/FX") // group
```

### Spatial Audio
Remember, the Spatial Audio of the Howler Library requires one more js file to be loaded, the "howler.spatial.js", add it to the AudioManager._audioMotorPath. After its inclusion, the Plugin will add two objects nodes into Godot, "AudioSpatial2D" and "AudioListener2D", both are used to set and config the spatial audio inside GoDot.
##### AudioSpatial2D
This node is the space position, all atributes are taken from the [Howler Spatial](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js#plugin-spatial)
- **audio_name** : name of the audio source you wish to play
- **orientation** : directional audio source, that is a point on a 3D Cartesian grid.
- **loop** : sets if the audio should loop or not.
- **volume** : volume of the audio, it uses GoDots volume value system (From -60 to 0), and converts its values to Howlers.
- **pitch** : It's the speed of the audio that is playing. (Giving the impression of a higher or lower Pitched Audio)
Any other atributes are from: [pannerAttr](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js#pannerattro-id).

### Playback Change Config
You can change the audio's configuration as you wish, in the same way as done on playbacks. For this, you have two methods that can help you.
- **update_config(_new_config,_group_name)**: change the configuration values of a group, the new settings will take effect in all audios inside the group. 
- **update_config_audio(_new_config,_audio_name)**: change the configuration values for a single audio source.

## Config
You can set any value to the Config Object, it will verify if any method or property exists, and if its found, it will update it for you.
```sh
#Example
AudioManager.update_config({mute:true},"Sound/FX")
```

## Implementation with another JS library
You may need to see the audioEngine.js file and manually update the methods for your new JS library.
